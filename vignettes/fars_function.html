National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) allows for export of raw accident data with one file covering single year of data.

Please obtain and store files in compressed CSV format, named according to this example: "accident_2013.csv.bz2" before using FARS functions of this package.

## Typical Workflow

As  a rule, you'll be using the functions in the following order:

- `make_filename` to get the name of a data file for the specified year
- `fars_read` to get full data for one year or 
- `fars_summarize_years` to get summary information for multiple years with monthly breakdown
- `fars_map_state` to have maps of accidents for the specified state and year plotted
